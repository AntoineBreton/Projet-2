# Projet-2 : App-Web Mezali & Moi

# Project Description

The Beauty Product Finder is our second project developed during our bootcamp. It is a web application that allows users to discover and find a curated selection of beauty products, with a primary focus on makeup. The application is built using React and JavaScript, providing a frontend solution.

## Why?

We embarked on this project to apply the concepts and techniques we learned during our bootcamp, particularly in React and JavaScript. It served as an opportunity to enhance our skills and gain practical experience in building a React application.

## What is the Goal?

The goal of the Beauty Product Finder is to provide users with a convenient way to explore and find their desired beauty products from a curated selection. Users can browse products based on various criteria such as price, category, and name. The application also allows users to add products to their cart, enabling them to save their favorite items and easily navigate to the merchant's website if they wish to make a purchase.

To achieve this, we integrated an API of our choice that provides a comprehensive database of beauty products. Using the data from the API, we were able to build the functionality and features required for a user experience.

## Features:

Intuitive search bars for searching products based on different criteria such as price, category, and name.
User-friendly navigation that allows users to quickly return to the home page or navigate to specific categories.
Cart functionality for adding and managing favorite products.
Seamless redirection to the merchant's website for purchasing the selected products.

## What's Next?

Implement a random product suggestion feature on the home page to showcase items that might be of interest to users.
Transition the application into an e-commerce platform where users can directly purchase products on the site.
Enhance the responsiveness of the application to ensure a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
Work on refining the overall design and aesthetics of the site to create an appealing visual experience for users.
